# PCB documentation template
Replace main header "PCB documentation template" with your project title

## Overview
**Repository:** Provide link to project repository
Provide a brief description of the project. 

## Usage
Provide instructions for user how to use or interact with the PCB 

### Pinout
Include a pinout schematic. This can help users understand how to interface with the PCB.

### Troubleshooting
Describe common issues that may arise during the PCB usage. Include guidance on identifying and resolving these issues.

## Design
### Requirements
Describe the purpose of the project and all requirements it has to fulfill

### Components
This section should highlight the most important components and their functions. 

### Schematic
Include an exported image of the PCB schematic.
Optionally describe any relevant details about the schematic design

### Layout
Include exported images of the PCB layouts
- Combined layout with dimensions. Include all important dimensions: PCB width and height, mounting holes size and position, etc.
- Combined layout without dimensions
- Separate layouts for each layer
Optionally describe any relevant details about the layout

### Reference Documentation
Include links to relevant reference documents such as datasheets for the components. When possible, host the documents in the project repository. It will guarantee they are easily accessible in the future, even If the original links would be no longer valid.

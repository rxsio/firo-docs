    ### Troubleshooting
    Describe common issues that may arise during the PCB usage. Include guidance on identifying and resolving these issues.

    !!! note
        Use admonitions for important information

    !!! bug
        Use `bug` admonition to document known bugs or issues in the system.

    ## Design
    ### Requirements
    Describe the purpose of the project and all requirements it has to fulfill

    !!! abstract
        Use `abstract` admonition to summarize key points or concepts succinctly.

    ### Components
    This section should highlight the most important components and their functions. 

    ### Schematic

    ### Reference Documentation
    Include links to relevant reference documents such as datasheets for the components. When possible, host the documents in the project repository. It will guarantee they are easily accessible in the future, even If the original links would be no longer valid.

    ## Firmware
    ### Overview
    Briefly describe function of the firmware. You may also describe firmware architecture, key components and dependencies.

    ### Usage
    Describe how to use the firmware. Include information about:

    - user interfaces or commands available  
    - settings, or parameters that can be customized

    ### Development  
    - Installing dependencies required for the development  
    - Setting up development environment  
    - Uploading firmware to the target device

    ## Manufacturing
    ### Manufacturing Considerations
    Include any manufacturing considerations for the PCB design, such as panelization, solder mask requirements, or impedance control.

    !!! warning
        Use `warning` admonition to highlight potential issues or cautionary advice.

    ### Assembly Instructions
    Include any specific guidelines or precautions that need to be followed during the assembly process.

    !!! tip
        Use `tip` admonition to share helpful advice or best practices.

    !!! danger
        Use `danger` admonition to alert users to critical issues or severe risks.

    ### Testing
    Describe the testing procedures and methodologies used to verify the functionality of the PCB. 

    !!! info 
        Use `info` admonition to provide additional context or background information.

    ## Conclusions
    Summarize the key findings of the PCB project. Provide recommendations for future improvements.

    !!! failure
        Use `failure` admonition to discuss failures or mistakes to avoid.

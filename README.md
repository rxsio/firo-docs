# FIRO documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the FIRO project. The documentation is written in Markdown format and stored in the `docs` folder. The documentation is automatically published on the website.

## Editing the Documentation

To edit the documentation, you can use any text editor that supports Markdown syntax. We recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as it provides an intuitive editing experience and allows you to treat the docs folder as a vault

If you prefer to use a different editor, please ensure that you adhere to the Markdown syntax supported by Obsidian to maintain compatibility with our documentation system.

Here's a step-by-step guide to editing the documentation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `docs` folder in your preferred text editor or Obsidian.
3. Create or modify Markdown files within the `docs` folder to add or update documentation content. Create subfolders within the `docs` folder to organize the documentation, 
4. Save and publish your changes

## Publishing Changes

Once you have made your changes to the documentation, you can publish them by following these steps:

1. Commit your changes: Use Git to commit your changes locally. If you're new to Git, you can refer to [Git - The Simple Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) for a beginner-friendly guide on Git basics.
2. Push your changes: Push your committed changes to the repository's main branch.
